<!-- Intro statement of field maps derived from ArcGIS online Resources-->
<p class="introduction">ArcGIS Field Maps is an excellent resource to allow users to capture asset inventories and observations in the field on maps that allow editing. Each asset and observation you capture has both a location and a form. Users will provide the location and fill out the provided form. 
This enables accurate data tracking and allows users to have data accesss at their finger tips.

    <h> Creating a New Map:</h>
</div>

<p class="introduction"> 
    First step was to create a public map on ArcGIS Online and sharing it with the group that was created for this assignment. This is where the Open Source Data for Waterloo water systems
    was added. We added the water distribution valve locations to the map and set it to public, the Field Maps form could start being created.

</div>


<div class="Problemstatementtext">
    <h> Set The Settings For The Field Maps App:</h>
</div>

<p class="introduction"> The map was then opened in Field Maps application, where we had to configure the app settings. First thing that was set was the collection tab, 
    where we set the location accuracy to 2 feet. This number was chosen based on how important accurate data is for field work, as the more accuracte it is the more efficient workflow
will be for municipalities. The accurate locations of these features are critical to have for each house hold incase of emergency situations. </p>

</div>


<div class="Problemstatementtext">
    <h> Creating a Form For The Application:</h>
</div>

<p class="introduction"> Following the previous step, a form needed to be created in the Field Maps environment to allow data collection to occur. These forms are layer specific, 
    and in order to create a form you must click the layer you want the form to be based off of. Once you click the form you have to click the convert pop-up button to add the already exisiting fields from the layer
    to the form. You can drag and drop elements to the form you are building, which then generates a form based off the fields from the selected layer. When this form is created, this process is able to be
    tested in the mobile application.
</p>

<div class="Problemstatementtext">
    <h> Adding Point On The Mobile Field Maps Application:</h>
</div>

<p class="introduction"> Now that the form is created, you can open the Field Maps App on your mobile device and the map created in the previous steps will appear in this space. This is because when you download Field Maps on your
    mobile device, it will require you to sign in to ArcGIS Online which is linked to the map you created. This will allow you to see any webmaps you have created in the ArcGIS Online space and use them within field maps.
    You would proceed by clicking on this map to open it, it will show all the data on the map and give you access to edit it. </p>

  

<p class="introduction"> An icon at the bottom right corner will then be visible indicating you add data. This is shown as a "+" button. When you click on this button ,the application will then require you to 
    select the type of feature that you would like to add (This will be dependent on the layers that you are showing in the map). For this map, the only option that will appear is the 'point' option as it is 
    the only layer specified within the map. When you select this option, the form that you generated will appear and indicate that field information needs to be filled out. The sections shown with an asteriks are 
    required to be filled out as the ones without are not. </p>

<p class="introduction"> The option to add a point will then appear which will correspond to the information that you filled out in the form. You must simply select an area on the map to add the point
    (Try to be as accurate as possible based on your location), or you can let your GPS coordinates determine your current location and plot the point where you are based off latitude and longitude coordinates. 
    Finally, select the submit button located at the top left corner of the screen to update the map with the new point created.
 </p>

 

<div class="Problemstatementtext">
    <h> Ensure Point Is Added Into The Map:</h>
</div>
<p class="introduction"> When you click submit, you will be returned to the map viewer screen where you can then view your newly added point. If you would like to see the field data
    that was enetered in the form, you can simply click on the point and the form information will come up. This gives you the accessibility to see all the information for the corresponding
    point that was added. If you need to add in multiple points, this process can be repeated and all the points will have as much data as you provide within the form. </p>

<div class="Problemstatementtext">
    <h> Overview:</h>
</div>

<p class="introduction"> Having the opportunity to explore this solution in greater depth has allowed us as a group to see the benefits of using Field Maps. The functionality of this application
    is what is needed in the industry when plotting points to see curb stop locations. This could be of benefit if more municipalities were to use this and could easily allow the edits of previously inputted 
    points if needed. The final benefit to this is that if municipalituie choose to implement this method of collecting data, as soon as previsou data is brought in to the map as a new layer, this 
    data can also be edited. This provides the user with maximum functionality and less restrictions. This therefore provides the solution and the avenue that we chose to explore in the field maps </p>


<div class="Problemstatementtext">
    <h> Setbacks and Problems In The Process:</h>
</div>

<p class="introduction"> Although there are many visible benefits to the applications, there are also some problems and limitations that can be encountered in the process. A first limitations is
    that if you try to add in a point and is not within the 2 feet (GPS), it will warn you on your mobile device and will need you to bypass the screen by pressing the add point button twice. 
    This can also be seen as a benefit though as it helps to ensure accuracy in the points based on the distance restrition set when setting up the application. Another Problem is that the application
    alows you to place points in random locations if you wish to do so. This will have to be approved with the form being filled out as confirmation and the various buttons that have to be pressed.
    Although, there still is some risk that some innacrurate points can be added in as well as adding in points by accidents. A final area that could lead to come issues were if there were to be 
    multiple different layers within the map. This may create some confusion as to what type of feature is what especially if there are mutiple features of the same type (Point, Line or Polygon).   </p>
