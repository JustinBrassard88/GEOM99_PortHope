<!-- Intro statement of field maps derived from ArcGIS online Resources-->
<p class="introduction">ArcGIS Field Maps is an excellent resource to allow users to capture asset inventories and observations in the field on maps that allow editing. Each asset and observation you capture has both a location and a form. Users will provide the location and fill out the provided form. 
This enables accurate data tracking and allows users to have data accesss at their finger tips.

    <h> Creating a New Map:</h>

<p class="introduction"> 
    First step was to create a public map on ArcGIS Online and sharing it with the group that was created for this assignment. This is where the Open Source Data for Waterloo water systems
    was added. We added the water distribution valve locations to the map and set it to public, the Field Maps form could start being created.
</p>
</div>

<div class="Problemstatementtext">
    <h> Set The Settings For The Field Maps App:</h>

<p class="introduction"> The map was then opened in Field Maps application, where we had to configure the app settings. First thing that was set was the collection tab, 
    where we set the location accuracy to 2 feet. This number was chosen based on how important accurate data is for field work, as the more accuracte it is the more efficient workflow
will be for municipalities. The accurate locations of these features are critical to have for each house hold incase of emergency situations. </p>
</div>

<div class="Problemstatementtext">
    <h> Creating a Form For The Application:</h>

<p class="introduction"> Following the previous step, a form needed to be created in the Field Maps environment to allow data collection to occur. These forms are layer specific, 
    and in order to create a form you must click the layer you want the form to be based off of. Once you click the form you have to click the convert pop-up button to add the already exisiting fields from the layer
    to the form. You can drag and drop elements to the form you are building, which then generates a form based off the fields from the selected layer. When this form is created, this process is able to be
    tested in the mobile application.
</p>
</div>

<div class="Problemstatementtext">
    <h> Adding a Randomized Point On The Mobile Field Maps Application:</h>

<p class="introduction"> 
    Now that the form is created, you can open the Field Maps App on your mobile device and the map created in the previous steps will appear in your ArcGIS Online account as a map. 
    If you click on this map to open it, it will show all the data on the map and give you access to edit it. You then click on the bottom right "+" button

    <h> Fill Out The Form Created and Check The GPS Accuracy:</h>

<p class="introduction"> Waterloo is a city located in Ontario situated near Guelph and Kitchener. The region of Waterloo was established in 1973 and it is situated southwest of 
    the City of Toronto. As GIS has many applications the growth of accesibility of technology is key in the success of many tasks throughout municipalities. Since the population
    has been rapidly booming in the City of Toronto over the last 10 years, it is important to realize that the surrounding cities will also grow. This is due to the fact that Toronto 
    cannot hold all the population and requires people to buy houses more on the outskirts of the City. Since Waterloo is one of these areas, there is a constant growth in municpal tasks 
    for the government. Analyzing curb stops is one of these factors. It is key to know where the locations of these features are incase of emergencies and future planning.</p>
