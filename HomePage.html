    <h> Background Information:</h>

<p class="introduction"> Waterloo is a city located in Ontario situated near Guelph and Kitchener. The region of Waterloo was established in 1973 and it is situated southwest of 
    the City of Toronto. As GIS has many applications the growth of accesibility of technology is key in the success of many tasks throughout municipalities. Since the population
    has been rapidly booming in the City of Toronto over the last 10 years, it is important to realize that the surrounding cities will also grow. This is due to the fact that Toronto 
    cannot hold all the population and requires people to buy houses more on the outskirts of the City. Since Waterloo is one of these areas, there is a constant growth in municpal tasks 
    for the government. Analyzing curb stops is one of these factors. It is key to know where the locations of these features are incase of emergencies and future planning.

    <h> The Purpose Of Creating This Solution:</h>


<p class="introduction"> For this project, we determined a solution for the curb stops valves and water service lines for the Regional Municipality of Waterloo. This solution was meant to be implemented 
    for the Municipality of Port Hope, but since the group was unable to obtain the data in the correct format, we decided to use prexisting data to further test the capabilities of various
    applications. Waterloo was selected as a point of interest for this solution as they has pre-existing data available and would allow us to examine applications such as field maps and dashboards in great
    depth. This solution could possibly be used to some extent to further progress on the Port Hope Collaborative project in the upcoming semester.

<h>Our Problem Statement:</h>
<p class="textproblem">In order to come up with a solution to our problem, we decided that it would be best to use ArcGIS Dashboards and FieldMaps and explore those in greater detail.
    The goal of exploring these applications is to generate a user interface in the form of a mobile web app to display curb stop locations for waterlines. Curb stop locations 
    are often plotted innacurately and having a mobile web app will allow the user to plot these valves with some form of precision due to the Latitude and Longitude coordinates that
    your mobile app will display. It is key to remember that when creating this application, having the different types of pipes visible will provide a great advantage to the user of 
    the interface. Knowing that lead pipes will have to be replaced is important as these can lead to lead poisoning within the water. This is one of various advantages that will be 
    highlighted throughout this solution. Shown below is the vision the group has for how we wish to implement these applications in the form of a problem statement.
