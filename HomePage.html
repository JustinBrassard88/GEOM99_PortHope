    <p> Background Information:</p>
</div>
<!--Introduction Statement-->
<p class="introduction"> The City of Waterloo is located in Southwestern Ontario near Guelph and Kitchener. The Region of Waterloo was established in 1973 and is situated southwest 
    of the City of Toronto. The growing popularity of GIS has allowed municipalities to better manage assets and share information with citizens. Since the population has been rapidly booming 
    in the City of Toronto over the last 10 years, many of the surrounding cities are continuting to grow. This is because Toronto cannot house the full population and requires people to buy 
    houses on the outskirts of the City. Since Waterloo is one of these areas, there is a growing need of the municipality to keep adequate track of city infrastructure. Water service lines 
    and valves are important utility infrasturcture to keep track of. It is important to know the locations of valves incase of emergencies and future planning.</p>

<div class="Problemstatementtext">
    <p> The Purpose Of Creating This Solution:</p>
</div>

<p class="introduction"> For this project, we created a solution to display curb stops valves and water service lines for the Municipality of Waterloo. Our solution also incorporates a mobile 
    Field Maps solution to facilitate collection and editing of valve points. Waterloo has water service data available on their open source platform. This data was used in our solution to create
    maps for a dashboard and a mobile web app. Recently, municipalities have been tasked with replacing lead pipes in their infrastructure due to toxic contamination. Having this data visualized
    as a dashboard would allow for cities to make more informed decisions.</p>

<div class="Problemstatementtext">
    <p>Our Problem Statement:</p>
    </div>

<p class="textproblem">In order to come up with a solution to our problem, we decided that it would be best to use ArcGIS Dashboards and FieldMaps and explore those in greater detail.
    The goal of exploring these applications is to generate a user interface in the form of a mobile web app to display, collect and edit curb stop locations. Curb stop locations 
    are often plotted innacurately and having a mobile web app will allow the user to plot these valves with some form of precision due to the Latitude and Longitude coordinates that
    a mobile device or GPS will display. When creating the dashboard, having different types of pipe material visible will provide a great advantage to the users of the interface. Knowing 
    where lead pipes are to be replaced is important as these can lead to poisoning within potable water. This is one of various advantages that will be highlighted throughout this solution. 
    Shown below is the vision the group has for how we wish to implement these applications in the form of a problem statement.
