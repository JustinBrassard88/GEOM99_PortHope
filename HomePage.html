<!-- Header For First Introduction Text -->
<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p> For this project, we determined a solution for the curb stops valves and water service lines for the Regional Municipality of Waterloo. This solution was meant to be implemented 
    for the Municipality of Port Hope, but since the group was unable to obtain the data in the correct format, we decided to use prexisting data to further test the capabilities of various
    applications. Waterloo was selected as a point of interest for this solution as they has pre-existing data available and would allow us to examine applications such as field maps and dashboards in great
    depth. This solution could possibly be used to some extent to further progress on the Port Hope Collaborative project in the upcoming semester.

<h1>Problem Statement</h1>
<p> <b>Ideal -</b> User interface (From a workers perspective) for a mobile Web map to display curb stop locations for water lines </p>
<p> <b>Reality -</b> There is no web map currently exisiting showing the curb stop locations for municipality of Waterloo for water lines.  It is hard without a mobile applications to 
    identify current curb stop locations for waterlines based on the pre-existing data. (Updates are not as convenient) </p>
<p> <b>Consequences -</b> Without a map it will be difficult to determine where locations of curb stops are to be monitored/maintained, especially in emergency situations these locations 
    can be critical to know exactly where they are for home owners and the municipality. </p>
<p> <b>Proposal -</b>Create an interactive web map application visualizing water service line data for the Regional Municipality of Waterloo. This will allow users to locate curb stops and 
    service lines for drinking water. Users should be able to interact with features with popup windows showing the needed attributes of curb stops.  Data will be aquired Online from 
    previous projects involving curb stop locations. </p>
