<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p> As a group, we strive to provide the best solution possible for the Port Hope project problem statement shown below. Incorporated throughout this task, we ha ve determiend that 
    a final product which incorporates Fields maps would be the most useful.</p>

<h1>Problem Statement</h1>
<p> Ideal - User interface (Worker perspective) for mobile Web map to display curb stop locations for water lines </p>
<p> Reality - There is no web map currently exisiting showing the curb stop locations for municipality of Port Hope for water lines.  It is hard without a mobile applications to 
    identify current curb stop locations for waterlines based on the pre existing data. (Updates are not as convenient) </p>
<p> Consequences - Without a map it will be difficult to determine where locations of curb stops are to be monitored/maintained, especially in emergency situations these locations 
    can be critical to know exactly where they are for home owners and the municipality. </p>
<p> Proposal - Create an interactive web map application visualizing water service line data for the municipality of Port Hope. This will allow users to locate curb stops and 
    service lines for drinking water. Users should be able to interact with features with popup windows showing the needed attributes of curb stops.  Data will be aquired from 
    the Municipality of Port Hope. </p>
