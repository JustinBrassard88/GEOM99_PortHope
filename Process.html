<p class="introduction"> Following the previous step, a form needed to be created in the Field Maps environment to allow data collection to occur. These forms are layer specific, 
    and in order to create a form you must click the layer you want the form to be based off of. Once you click the form you have to click the convert pop-up button to add the already exisiting fields from the layer
    to the form. You can drag and drop elements to the form you are building, which then generates a form based off the fields from the selected layer. When this form is created, this process is able to be
    tested in the mobile application.
