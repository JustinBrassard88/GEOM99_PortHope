    <h> Creating Web Maps to be displayed on dashboard:</h>
    </div>

<p class="introduction"> From the City of Waterloo's open source platform, two separate Web Maps were created on ArcGIS Online, One map showing the locations 
    curbstop valves and the other displaying service lines (respective of the images below).

    <h> Initializing Map on Dashboard:</h>
</div>

<p class="introduction"> A new Dashboard was created on ArcGIS Online and the Web Maps from the previous step were added in as source data. Once the map was initialized, 
    different elements were added and configured.

    <h> Configuring Map Element:</h>
</div>

<p class="introduction"> As seen in the image below, Map elements were created for a more online interactive approach with users. The setters were set to enable popups,
    default extent and bookmarks, legend, and zooming in/out. This allows for the user of our dashboard to click on feautres and see different attributes of the data. 
    It also shows the legend containing various materials and being able to zoom in and out of the map.

<div class="Problemstatementtext">
    <h> Configuring Pie Chart Element:</h>
</div>

<p class="introduction"> The desired data layer was selected to use for a pie chart. In this case, the water service layer was chosen to show the varying material of service lines
    in Waterloo. Since majority of Waterloo's service data had unknown material, there were filtered out in order to prevent skew in the pie chart. The pie chart grouped values based on
    material and displays the count for each material type. An inner radius of 50% was applied under chart options to give the pie chart a donut shape.

    <h> Configuring List Element:</h>
</div>

<p class="introduction"> The last thing we added was a list element to our Dashboard, which displays information on service lines that are made of lead or lines with unknown material
    installed before 1950 as these are likely lead as well. These were filtered under data options to only include specific lines in the list. These were configured under list options, and data was pulled from the source layer were included in {}.
