    <p> Introduction:</p>
    </div>
<!--Introduction Statement-->
<p class="introduction"> ArcGIS Dashboards is an excellent resource to allow users to capture an overview of a map with corresponding statistics that relate to it.
    Widgets can be added into this interface to increase accessibility and visual impact of the Dashboard. We chose to use an ArcGIS Dashboard as it is an interactive approach 
    to allow users to visually see the data and statistics we are working with. We wanted to showcase the various functionality and options Dashboard has to offer by adding a legend, a pie chart,
    configuring lists, indicators and altering the header. This process is shown in the steps below.</p>

<!--First step in the process-->

<div class="Problemstatementtext">
    <p> Creating Web Maps to be displayed on dashboard:</p>
    </div>

<p class="introduction"> Using City of Waterloo's open source data, two separate Web Maps were created on ArcGIS Online- one map showing the locations of
    curbstop valves and the other displaying service lines (as seen below).</p>

<!--creating a dashboard-->
<div class="Problemstatementtext">
    <p> Initializing Map on Dashboard:</p>
</div>

<p class="introduction"> A new Dashboard was created on ArcGIS Online and the Web Maps from the previous step were added in as source data. Once the map was initialized, 
    different elements were added and configured. </p>

    <p> Configuring Map Element:</p>
</div>

<p class="introduction"> As seen in the image below, map elements to display both service lines and valves. Settigns were toggled to enable popups,
    default extent and bookmarks, legend, and zooming in/out. This allows for the user of our dashboard to click on feautres and see different attributes of the data. 
    It also shows the legend containing various materials and being able to zoom in and out of the map. </p>

<!--adding cool elements to dashboard to make it more appealing to the user-->
<div class="Problemstatementtext">
    <p> Configuring Pie Chart Element:</p>
</div>

<p class="introduction"> The desired data layer was selected to use for a pie chart. In this case, the water service layer was chosen to show the varying material of service lines
    in Waterloo. Since majority of Waterloo's service data had unknown material, these were filtered out in order to prevent skew in the pie chart. The pie chart grouped values based on
    material and displays the count for each material type. An inner radius of 50% was applied under chart options to give the pie chart a donut shape. </p>

</div>


<div class="Problemstatementtext">
    <p> Configuring List Element:</p>
</div>

<p class="introduction"> A list element was added to our dashboard to displays information on service lines that are made of lead or lines with unknown material
    installed before 1950 as these are likely lead as well. These were filtered under data options to only include these specific lines in the list. The format of each list item was configured under list options 
    and data pulled from the source layer were included in {}.</p>

    </div>
    
    <p class="introduction"> Multiple indicators were used to display numeric attributes/statistics. One indicator was configured to display the estimated cost of all lead pipes. 
        This same filter was applied to the list element to only use pipes made of lead or unknown material pipes installed pre-1950. This indicator sums the lengths of all service 
        lines that fall within the filter and multiples the number by 191. This results in the estimated cost of replacing the pipes based on an estimated rate of $191/m of pipe.</p>

<!--adding a title/header to dashboard-->
<div class="Problemstatementtext">
    <p> Configuring Header</p>
    </div>
        
<p class="introduction"> We used a header to reserve an area at the top of our dashboard to display a title and allowing the users to navigate through multiple selectors to find a 
    specific address. Three category selectors were set: Street Name, Street Number, Address. Each of these selectors filters the options of the latter so the user can narrow down 
    their choice. Filters were also set on the map element so it pans to a selected area based on user input</p>

<!--Overview of creating a dashboard-->
<div class="Problemstatementtext">
    <p> Overview:</p>
    </div>

<p class="introduction"> Having the opportunity to explore the capabilities and accessibility that can be incorporated within a dashboard allowed us to see the benefits of potentially
    implementing something similar in our Collaborative Project. There are advantages and disadvantages to using dashboard, although overall it shows a well thought out solution incorporating the statistical portion of our topic in an visually appealing way. </p>

<!--setbacks and problems we encountered while making a dashboard-->
<div class="Problemstatementtext">
    <p> Setbacks and Concerns:</p>
    </div>


<div class="problemsandconcerns">    
    <p>1. Accessibility Issues </p>
    </div>
<!--advisor warned us of accessibility issues so we dug a little deeper-->
<p class="introduction">Our dashboard was initially designed using a dark web map and all colour schemes for elements were left as the default options.
    Although the Dashboard appeared fine on a large, high resolution display when running a Lighthouse report on the page, many assessibility issues appeared.
    These issues were mainly due to the contrast ratio between background and foreground colours. The colour scheme of the failing elements were modifyied to prevent low contrast 
    items that are difficult for users to see and read. Our final iteration of the dashboard involved changing the base map to a light gray canvas and altering the colours used 
    for attributes. Careful attention was paid to the contrast between background and foreground elements. The final version of our dashboard had no accessibility issues for the colour use.</p>

</div>

<div class="problemsandconcerns">  
    <p>2. Category Element Selector Crashing</p>
    </div>

<p class="introduction"> The first iteration of our dashboard contained a single category selector in our header. This selector was to allow for a user to zoom to a location on the 
    map by selecting an address of their choice. The City of Waterloo’s data had over 32,000 unique addresses that the user can choose from. This caused the dropdown list to take a 
    significantly long time to load and often times caused the dashboard to crash. To work around this, new data columns were added using ArcGIS Pro- one for Street Number and one 
    for Street Address. Using the following two scripts to populate the columns, we were able to separate the address into its respective number and street.By splitting the selector 
    into street name and number, the result was a bit over 700 unique street names in Waterloo. Having this many options in the dropdown did not cause any lag nor result in the 
    dashboard crashing.</p>

<div class="problemsandconcerns">  
    <p>3. Arcade in ArcGIS Dashboards</p>
    </div>

<p class="introduction"> Although dashboards offer many click and set options to configure elements, our team found that we were limited in options to customize our dashboard to our liking. 
    To really enhance our dashboard with advanced settings, our team set some time to learn and understand the use of Arcade expressions. We were able to implement a simple Arcade expression 
    (shown below) to change the colour of a list item based on the value. Using the code below, the text colour for unknown materials becomes red and orange for lead.</p>

</div>
        
<div class="problemsandconcerns">  
    <p>4. ArcGIS Online Assistant</p>
    </div>

<p class="introduction"> ArcGIS Online Assistant can be used to view the underlying JSON for our dashboard in ArcGIS Online. While viewing the JSON for our dashboard, we were able to 
    adjust settings that would not be an option on the dashboards user interface. For example, on our dashboards JSON, we were able to adjust settings such as the number of times a 
    selected feature flashes. The default is 3 and cannot be changed on ArcGIS Dashboards. Through the Online Assistant, we were able to change this to 7 so the user of our dashboard 
    can easily directly their focus to the selected item. Substantial care was taken in altering the JSON of our dashboard as this is an untested and unsupported feature. We ensured we 
    had our dashboard backed up before adjusting various settings.</p>
